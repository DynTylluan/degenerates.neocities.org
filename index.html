		<h2>In sum:</h2>
			<p>Degenerates is the personal brand of Froge. I’ve written over 700,000 words on digital art with the hope that you, yes, <em>you,</em> will follow my example and go on to create work that you can be proud of in the same way I’m proud of mine.</p>
			<p>The tone of Degenerates is self-depreciating and flippant, though ultimately serious. The projects within are best described as <em>blogs</em> — nothing more, nothing less. They’re funny, and if they’re not funny, they’re thoughtful. They challenge your intellect and engage with you in a visceral way that we don’t even get in our real lives.</p>
			<p>There are two laws of Degenerates: knowledge, and truth. If I do not teach you what I know, I have failed. If I am not honest in what I teach, I have failed. It’s from these moral rights I express ideas from all the subjects I feel qualified to talk about. The value is not only in <em>what</em> I express, but <em>how</em> I express it in that particular, inimitable way that I’ve never seen expressed before.</p>
			<p>I write for people who are like me; your interest in what I create depends on your own view of the world. If you hate mediocrity and strive for goodness in all things, then I will be of service to you. And if I perform this service to the best of my ability, having come out a more learned, more fulfilled, just-plain-better human being than who I was before, then I will have the privilege to look back on my life having done what I love instead of being chained to what I fear.</p>
			<p>Be good at what you do, for nobody can do good for you. The best artists lead by example… this is just what I do.</p>
